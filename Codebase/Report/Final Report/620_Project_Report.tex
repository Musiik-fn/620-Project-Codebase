\subsection{Skilled Nusing Facility Cost Report}


Medicare-certified institutional providers are required to submit annual cost reports. These data files contain the highest level of cost report status for cost reports in each reported fiscal years. The cost report contains provider information such as facility characteristics, utilization data, cost and charges by cost center (in total and for Medicare), Medicare settlement data, and financial statement data. CMS maintains the cost report data in the Healthcare Provider Cost Reporting Information System (HCRIS). Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) submit their cost report data to HCRIS using form CMS-2540-2010. The reports used are from the years 2015 through 2021.
