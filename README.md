# BANA 607 PROJECT

## Overview
Due to the significant number of baby boomers exploring nursing home options, your company has been tasked with determining whether it is advisable to suggest your client invest in nursing homes. As a member of the data analysis team, you are required to perform an analysis to address this question using a comprehensive dataset of U.S. nursing homes for the years 2015-2021.

## Analysis Topics
1. Evaluate the overall financial performance of nursing homes in the United States during this period.
2. Identify the influential factors affecting the financial performance of nursing homes.
3. Determine the most significant factors impacting the performance of nursing homes.
4. Describe the trends in performance and these influential factors.
5. Analyze the impact of COVID-19.

## Team Formation
Students are permitted to collaborate in groups for this assignment, with each group consisting of no more than three students. If two teams submit projects with identical analyses, both teams will automatically receive a grade of zero for the project.
